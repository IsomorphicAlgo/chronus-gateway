# ChronusGateway-RS

ChronusGateway-RS (Chronus-GS) is an asynchronous, physics-validated Telemetry and Command
(TMTC) ground-station gateway written in Rust. It ingests raw spacecraft downlink frames,
parses them against open CCSDS standards, cross-checks each frame against the spacecraft's
computed orbital physics, and distributes validated telemetry to web-based mission control
dashboards such as NASA Open MCT — in a single, memory-safe, garbage-collection-free executable.

Its distinguishing feature is a **Physics-Telemetry Co-Validation** engine: rather than checking
telemetry only against static limits, the gateway uses a live orbital propagator to derive the
expected Doppler shift, look-angles, and link geometry for the spacecraft, and flags frames whose
measured RF and signal parameters disagree with the physics.

> **Status:** Roadmap through **Milestone 7** is implemented: M1–M6 as before, plus the
> **`chronus-hil-sim`** NeXosim driver (synthetic CCSDS TM over UDP) with ingest/soak tests and
> profiling notes in [`docs/HIL.md`](docs/HIL.md). See [`BUILD_PLAN.md`](BUILD_PLAN.md).

## Architecture

The gateway is built around two principles: an asynchronous, lock-free network core and a clean
abstraction boundary between the pipeline and any astrodynamics backend.

```
Raw RF / SDR ──▶ Async UDP ingestion ──▶ CCSDS zero-copy parser ──▶ Physics-Telemetry
 (UDP/TCP)        (Tokio)                  (validated frames)         Co-Validation engine
     ▲                                                                      │
     │            chronus-hil-sim ── synthetic CCSDS TM over UDP            │
     │                  (NeXosim, M7; loopback lab harness)                 │
                  OrbitalPropagator trait ◀── range-rate / look-angles ─────┤
                  (Ephemerust today, nyx-space later)                       ▼
                                                          Axum WebSocket ──▶ NASA Open MCT
```

- **Asynchronous core.** A Tokio runtime drives non-blocking UDP ingestion and a pool of
  WebSocket connections, scaling to many concurrent telemetry channels and operator screens.
- **Trait-based astrodynamics.** Physical-state computation is abstracted behind the
  `OrbitalPropagator` trait, decoupling the network and validation pipelines from the math
  library. The default backend is the SGP4-based Ephemerust library; the trait boundary leaves a
  clean path to a high-fidelity `nyx-space` backend without rewriting the gateway.

The reasoning behind these and other choices is recorded in [`Methodology.md`](Methodology.md).

## Building and running

The project targets Rust 1.88 or newer and consumes the Ephemerust library as a sibling
checkout. The expected on-disk layout places both repositories next to each other:

```
…/Rust/
├── chronus-gateway/
└── Ephemerust/
```

```bash
cargo build      # compile the workspace
cargo run -p chronus-gateway  # UDP ingest (127.0.0.1:7301) + HTTP/WebSocket (127.0.0.1:8080)
cargo test       # unit + integration + doctests
cargo bench -p chronus-gateway   # Criterion benchmarks (M6)
cargo run -p chronus-hil-sim --release -- 127.0.0.1:7301 2000   # NeXosim HIL (M7); run gateway first
```

See [`docs/HIL.md`](docs/HIL.md) for pairing with `GET /api/v1/chronus/metrics`.

Default bind addresses are loopback-only (`IngestConfig` / `StationConfig` in `config.rs`). The
binary currently uses those defaults directly: UDP `127.0.0.1:7301`, HTTP/WebSocket
`127.0.0.1:8080`, a public ISS reference TLE, and a generic nominal carrier of `437.5 MHz`. Set
`RUST_LOG=debug` for verbose tracing.

### HTTP, WebSocket, and Open MCT surface

| Endpoint | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe | Returns `{"status":"ok"}`. |
| `GET /api/v1/chronus/metrics` | Ingest + gateway counters | Includes UDP counters, WebSocket counters, and average processing latency. |
| `GET /api/v1/chronus/history` | History stub | Returns an explanatory `note` and an empty `packets` array. |
| `GET /api/v1/chronus/openmct/dictionary` | Dictionary stub | Returns an explanatory `note` and placeholder point identifiers. |
| `GET /telemetry/openmct` | WebSocket telemetry stream | One text JSON object per parsed CCSDS TM frame, schema `openmct.realtime.v1`. |

The stock gateway has orbital tracking enabled when the default `StationConfig` validates, so
WebSocket messages include look-angle and range fields when propagation succeeds. Doppler
co-validation requires measured RF metadata; the current binary passes `RfMetadata::default()`, so
bit 0 is skipped and only the elevation/horizon check can set `physics_flags` in normal operation.
See `validate.rs` and `Methodology.md` D-012/D-013 for the stable bitfield and JSON contract.

> **Windows note:** on the maintainer's machine the MSVC `link.exe` is blocked from writing
> freshly linked executables. The repository is therefore configured (`.cargo/config.toml`) to
> link with the toolchain's bundled `rust-lld`. See `Methodology.md` (D-008) for details.

## Testing

Testing is a first-class deliverable. The project follows a layered strategy — inline unit tests,
integration tests over loopback UDP and in-process WebSockets, NeXosim HIL tests in
`chronus-hil-sim`, doctests, and physics
co-validation tests with explicitly documented tolerances — enforced at every milestone's stage
gate. The full strategy and per-milestone test matrix are defined in [`TEST_PLAN.md`](TEST_PLAN.md).

## Acknowledgements

ChronusGateway-RS builds directly on prior work, and credit is given accordingly:

- **[Ephemerust](https://github.com/IsomorphicAlgo/ephemerust)** — the SGP4-based orbital
  mechanics and satellite-tracking library that provides the look-angle and range-rate
  computations underpinning the co-validation engine. Authored by the same maintainer.
- **Rusty_Server** — an earlier asynchronous networking and REST service by the same maintainer,
  whose Tokio/Axum architecture and integration patterns informed this gateway's design.
- **[`sgp4`](https://crates.io/crates/sgp4)** — the validated SGP4/SDP4 propagator that
  Ephemerust delegates to for numerical orbit propagation.
- **[Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)** and **[Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)** — the
  asynchronous runtime and web framework that form the network core.
- **[CCSDS](https://public.ccsds.org/)** — the open international standards for space packet
  framing and protocols that define the gateway's wire formats.
- **[NASA Open MCT](https://nasa.github.io/openmct/)** — the open-source mission-control
  framework targeted by the distribution layer.
- **[NeXosim](https://github.com/asynchronics/nexosim)** — the discrete-event simulation
  framework implemented by `chronus-hil-sim` for the Milestone 7 loopback HIL harness.

The broader Rust aerospace ecosystem — including `sat-rs`, `spacepackets`, and `nyx-space` —
informed the design analysis.
